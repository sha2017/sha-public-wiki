Semantic Maps is an extension that adds semantic capabilities to the [Maps extension]
(https://github.com/JeroenDeDauw/Maps). This
includes the ability to add, edit, aggregate and visualize coordinate data stored through
[Semantic MediaWiki](https://semantic-mediawiki.org/).

Since Semantic Maps uses the Maps API, you can use multiple mapping services. These include
Google Maps (with Google Earth support), OpenLayers and Leaflet.

Both Semantic Maps and Maps are based on Semantic Google Maps and Semantic Layers, and are
meant to replace these extensions. Having Semantic MediaWiki and Maps installed is a
prerequisite for the Semantic Maps extension; the code will not work without it.

## Documentation

* [Usage examples](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_Maps_examples)
* [Installation instructions](INSTALL.md)
* [Release notes](RELEASE-NOTES.md)

Note that the installation instructions might be out of date. Initiation now is done
the same way as that of the Maps extension.

## Contributing and support

Semantic Maps 3.4.2 is the last release of Semantic Maps as a dedicated extension.
It has been merged into the [Maps extension](https://github.com/JeroenDeDauw/Maps),
where development continues. All features available in Semantic Maps 3.4.2 are
available in Maps 4.0 and later.
